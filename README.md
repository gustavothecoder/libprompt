# libprompt

`libprompt` is a library to interpret CLI prompts. It can identify commands, options and option values.

## Installation

### Dependencies

You need to be able to compile C code. Installing `build-essential` for Debian-based distros or `base-devel` for Arch-based distros should be sufficient.

### Steps

Just run:
```bash
$ make install
```

To uninstall:
```bash
$ make uninstall
```

## Usage

Take a look at [gh](https://github.com/gustavothecoder/gh) source code, it uses `libprompt` and is very simple to understand.
